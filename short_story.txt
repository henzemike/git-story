This story is about the shortest day ever.
The man hit his alarm clock and waking up he went to the kitchen to make breakfast. 
He drank his protein shake went and crawled back in bed and that was the end of his day. 
He woke up the next day and did his normal routine! 
He did not have much of a life.
